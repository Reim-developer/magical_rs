# magical_rs ðŸª„

> **Detect file types by magic bytes â€” zero dependencies, pure Rust.**

`magical_rs` is a lightweight, dependency-free Rust crate that detects file types by matching **magic bytes (signatures)** at specific offsets â€” including tricky formats like `.iso` with signatures **32KB into the file**.

No external tools. No bloated dependencies. Just fast, reliable file type detection.

---

## Features

- **Zero dependencies** â€” pure Rust, `no_std`-friendly (with minor tweaks).
- **Accurate detection** â€” supports common formats (PNG, JPG, ZIP) and **deep-offset types like ISO, RPM, TAR**.
- **Smart header reading** â€” reads just enough bytes to detect all known types.
- **Python-compatible** â€” exposes clean PyO3 bindings for Python interop.
- **Fast & safe** â€” uses compile-time constants and safe slicing.
- **Extensible** â€” easy to add new signatures.
